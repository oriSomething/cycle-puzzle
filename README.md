# The 15 Cycle Puzzle

This is a version of “The 15 Puzzle” made in [Cycle JS](http://cycle.js.org/).

I have no attention to claim this repo represents the “best practice” of
[Cycle JS](http://cycle.js.org/). It's just me trying to learn
[Cycle JS](http://cycle.js.org/) and [xstream](http://staltz.com/xstream/).
